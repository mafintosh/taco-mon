Usage: taco-mon deploy <deploy-to-path>

Deploy a program tarball (e.g. from taco-pack or taco-build) into a directory,
then runs `taco-mon stop` and `taco-mon start` in the program.

You should write the tarball data to STDIN and specify the target path as the first argument.

Example: $ cat myapp.tar | taco-mon deploy .

See `taco-mon start -h` for the full list of start options.
